1 Introduction
**************

PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML and XML documents.  It works with
GNU Emacs 19.34, 20.3 and later or with XEmacs 19.9 and later.  PSGML
contains a simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. Functions
provided includes menus and commands for inserting tags with only the
contextually valid tags, identification of structural errors, editing of
attribute values in a separate window with information about types and
defaults, and structure based editing.

   SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".

   A good introduction to SGML is 'A Gentle Introduction to SGML'
produced by Text Encoding Initiative (this is really chapter 2 of TEI
P3).  This can be found on

     'ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/TEI/P3SG.DOC'.

   A SGML document has three major parts, in order:

  1. SGML Declaration ('<!SGML "ISO 8879:1986" ... >')
  2. Document Type Declaration ('<!DOCTYPE NAME ... >')
  3. Document Element ('<NAME> ... </NAME>')

   The SGML declaration contains general information about character
sets, concrete syntax, and SGML features used.  PSGML does not use the
SGML Declaration, it can be left out, and if included is ignored.  Many
SGML systems allow the SGML declaration to be defaulted.  PSGML always
use the Concrete Reference Syntax but without limitations on lengths.
Features used has to be indicated with variables (*note SGML
declaration::).

   The document type declaration specifies the valid elements and
entities and how they can be nested.  A document type is usually needed,
but can reside in another file (*note Managing the DTD::).

   The system declaration for PSGML:
     SYSTEM "ISO 8879:1986"
        CHARSET
          BASESET  "ISO 646-1983//CHARSET
                    International Reference Version (IRV)//ESC 2/5 4/0"

2 Installing PSGML
******************

To install PSGML you first need to uncompress and unpack the source
archive.  This is done with the 'gunzip' and 'tar' commands.

     gunzip psgml-1.2.0.tar.gz; tar xf psgml-1.2.0.tar

   This should create a subdirectory to the current directory with the
source code.  This directory contains a 'configure' command (see the
file INSTALL for more information about configure).  You can use the
'configure' command to configure the package or you can load the file
'psgml-maint' and execute the 'psgml-compile-files' command.

   Place the '*.el' and the '*.elc' files in a directory where Emacs can
find it (i.e.  one of the directories in the 'load-path' variable, you
can add a directory to this variable in your '.emacs'.)

   If you use the 'configure' approach, compile psgml with 'make' and
the you can run 'make install' to install it in the system library
'site-lisp'.  The location of 'site-lisp' is figured out by 'configure',
but you can change it in the 'Makefile'.

   Put the following line in your .emacs:

     (autoload 'sgml-mode "psgml" "Major mode to edit SGML files." t)
     (autoload 'xml-mode "psgml" "Major mode to edit XML files." t)

   You may also want to set up search paths for external entities, *Note
Entity manager::.

   The 'psgml.info' is the documentation for PSGML in the info format.
You can read this with the Emacs command 'C-u C-h i'.  You can also
install the file in your systems info directory and edit the 'dir' file
to include 'psgml.info' in the menu.

   The info file 'psgml.info' is created from the texinfo file
'psgml.texi'.  The texinfo file can also be used to create a hard copy
of the documentation.  To do this you need the TeX program and a copy of
'texinfo.tex'.

3 How to invoke PSGML
*********************

PSGML defines major modes called 'sgml-mode' and 'xml-mode'.  Files with
extensions '.sgml', '.sgm' or '.dtd' will automatically be edited in
SGML mode.  To edit some other file in SGML mode, type 'M-x sgml-mode
<RET>' after finding the file.  To edit XML files, type 'M-x xml-mode
<RET>'.

   If you can modify the file you can add a "Local Variables" list
(*note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)file variables.) to the end of
the file.  This can make Emacs automatically set sgml mode and user
options when the file is loaded.  The simplest Local Variables list
would look like:

     <!--
     Local Variables:
     mode: sgml
     End:
     -->

   You can also put a line at the top of the file to tell emacs to use
sgml mode:

     <!-- -*- sgml -*- -->

   For XML replace 'sgml' with 'xml' in the above examples.  But
remember that you can't have a comment before the _SGML declaration_ or
the _XML declaration_.


File: psgml.info,  Node: Entity manager,  Next: Validate,  Prev: Invoke,  Up: Top

4 The Entity Manager
********************

SGML can refer to an external file (really entity) with an _external
identifier_, this is a _public identifier_ or a _system identifier_, or
both.

   A typical public identifier looks like

     PUBLIC "ISO 8879:1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN"

where "ISO 8879:1986" is the owner, "ENTITIES" is the text class and
"Added Latin 1" is the text description (and "EN" is language).

   A system identifier looks like

     SYSTEM "htmlplus.dtd"

where "htmlplus.dtd" is a system-specific identifier.

   To map external identifiers to file names, PSGML first searches
entity catalog files and then search the list of file name templates in
the variable 'sgml-public-map'.

   The catalog format is according to SGML/Opens resolution on entity
management.  The catalog consists of a series of entries and comments.
A comment is delimited by '--' like in a markup declaration.  The entry
types recognized are described in the following table.

'public PUBID FILE'
     The FILE will be used for the entity text of an entity with the
     public identifier PUBID.

'entity NAME FILE'
     The FILE will be used for the entity text of an entity with the
     name NAME.  If the NAME starts with a '%' the rest of the name will
     be matched against parameter entities.

'doctype NAME FILE'
     The FILE will be used for the entity text of an entity used as
     external subset of a document declaration with NAME as document
     type name.

'sgmldecl FILE'
     Used to specify a default SGML declaration.  Recognized but not
     used by PSGML other than to pass to an external validation command
     ('sgml-validate-command').

   When PSGML is looking for the file containing an external entity, the
following things will be tried in order:

  1. Try the system identifier, as a file name, if there is a system
     identifier and the variable 'sgml-system-identifiers-are-preferred'
     is non-'nil' and there is no elements containing '%s' in
     'sgml-public-map'.  If the system identifier is a relative file
     name it will be relative to the directory containing the defining
     entity.

  2. Look thru each catalog in 'sgml-local-catalogs' and
     'sgml-catalog-files' in order.  For each catalog look first for
     entries matching the public identifier, if any.  Then look for
     other matching entries in the order they appear in the catalog.

     Currently an entry will be ignored if it is matching but its file
     is non-existent or unreadable.  (This is under reconsideration,
     perhaps it should signal error instead).

  3. Try the system identifier, if any, as a file name.  If
     'sgml-system-identifiers-are-preferred' is 'nil' and there is no
     elements containing '%s' in 'sgml-public-map'.

  4. Try the entries in 'sgml-public-map'.  Using the catalogs are
     preferred.  The 'sgml-public-map' may disappear in a future version
     of PSGML (not soon though).

   The 'sgml-public-map' variable can contain a list of file name
templates where '%P' will be substituted with the whole public
identifier, owner is substituted for '%O', public text class for '%C',
and public text description for '%D'.  The text class will be converted
to lower case and the owner and description will be transliterated
according to the variable 'sgml-public-transliterations'.  The templates
in the list is tried in order until an existing file is found.  The
'sgml-public-map' is modeled after 'sgmls' environment variable
'SGML_PATH' and psgml understand the following substitution characters:
%%, %N, %P, %S, %Y, %C, %L, %O, %T, and %V. The default value of
'sgml-public-map' is taken from the environment variable 'SGML_PATH'.

   Given the public identifier above and the file name template
'/usr/local/lib/sgml/%o/%c/%d', the resulting file name is

     /usr/local/lib/sgml/ISO_8879:1986/entities/Added_Latin_1

   Note: blanks are transliterated to '_' (and also '/' to '%') and the
text class is down cased.

 -- User Option: sgml-catalog-files
     This is a list of catalog entry files.  The files are in the format
     defined in the SGML Open Draft Technical Resolution on Entity
     Management.  The Emacs variable is initialized from the environment
     variable 'SGML_CATALOG_FILES' or if this variable is undefined the
     default is

          ("CATALOG" "/usr/local/lib/sgml/CATALOG")

 -- User Option: sgml-local-catalogs
     A list of SGML entity catalogs to be searched first when parsing
     the buffer.  This is used in addition to 'sgml-catalog-files', and
     'sgml-public-map'.  This variable is automatically local to the
     buffer.

 -- User Option: sgml-system-identifiers-are-preferred
     If 'nil', PSGML will look up external entities by searching the
     catalogs in 'sgml-local-catalogs' and 'sgml-catalog-files' and only
     if the entity is not found in the catalogs will a given system
     identifier be used.  If the variable is non-nil and a system
     identifier is given, the system identifier will be used for the
     entity.  If no system identifier is given the catalogs will
     searched.

 -- User Option: sgml-public-map
     This should be a list of file name templates.  This variable is
     initialized from the environment variable 'SGML_PATH'.  This is the
     same environment variable that 'sgmls' uses.  If the environment
     variable is undefined the default is

          ("%S" "/usr/local/lib/sgml/%o/%c/%d")

5 Running an external SGML parser
*********************************

PSGML can not validate an SGML document (see below what it can and can't
do).  If you have a validating SGML parser, like 'sgmls', you can run
the parser on your file with the command 'C-c C-v' ('sgml-validate').

   Some variables control this function:

 -- User Option: sgml-validate-command
     The shell command to validate an SGML document.

     This is a 'format' control string that by default should contain
     two '%s' conversion specifications: the first will be replaced by
     the value of 'sgml-declaration' (or the empty string, if nil); the
     second will be replaced by the current buffer's file name (or the
     empty string, if nil).

     If 'sgml-validate-files' is non-nil, the format string should
     contain one '%s' conversion specification for each element of its
     result.

     If sgml-validate-command is a list, then every element should be a
     string.  The strings will be tried in order and '%'-sequences in
     the string will be replaced according to the list below, if the
     string contains '%'-sequences with no replacement value the next
     string will be tried.

     '%b'
          means the visited file of the current buffer

     '%s'
          means the SGML declaration specified in the sgml-declaration
          variable

     '%d'
          means the file containing the DOCTYPE declaration, if not in
          the buffer

     The default value is 'nsgmls -s %s %s'.

 -- User Option: sgml-validate-files
     If non-nil, a function of no arguments that returns a list of file
     names.  These file names will serve as the arguments to the
     'sgml-validate-command' format control string instead of the
     defaults.

 -- User Option: sgml-declaration
     The name of the SGML declaration file.

 -- User Option: sgml-offer-save
     If non-nil, 'C-c C-v' ('sgml-validate') will ask about saving
     modified buffers before running the validate command.  The default
     value is 't'.

   The built-in parser can find some markup errors.  The command 'C-c
C-o' ('sgml-next-trouble-spot') is the best way to use the built-in
parser for this.  To check the whole file go to the beginning of the
buffer and use 'C-c C-o'.

   Some of the markup errors not found are:

   * Errors in the SGML declaration.
   * Errors in attribute specifications.
   * Omitted start-tags for empty elements.


File: psgml.info,  Node: SGML declaration,  Next: Managing the DTD,  Prev: Validate,  Up: Top

6 SGML Declaration
******************

PSGML does not understand the SGML declaration, it accepts one in the
file but it is ignored.  If you have the SGML declaration in another
file you can make 'sgmls' use it when you use the 'C-c C-v'
('sgml-validate') command (*note Validate::).

   PSGML has some options in what features it uses and what markup it
creates.  You have to set these options to make PSGML's behavior
consistent with your SGML declaration and personal preferences.

 -- User Option: sgml-omittag
     Set this to 't' if the SGML declaration has 'OMITTAG YES' and to
     'nil' otherwise.

 -- User Option: sgml-shorttag
     Set this to 't' if the SGML declaration has 'SHORTTAG YES' and to
     'nil' otherwise.

 -- User Option: sgml-namecase-general
     Set this to 't' if the SGML declaration has 'NAMECASE GENERAL YES'
     and to 'nil' otherwise.  I.e., this controls whether names, except
     entity names, will be case insensitive (translated to upper case).

 -- User Option: sgml-always-quote-attributes
     If non-nil, quote all attribute values inserted after finishing
     edit attributes.  If this variable is 'nil' and 'sgml-shorttag' is
     non-'nil', attribute values that consists of only name characters
     will not be quoted.

 -- User Option: sgml-minimize-attributes
     Determines minimization of attributes inserted by edit-attributes.
     If non-nil, omit attribute name if the attribute value is from a
     token group.  If 'max', omit attributes with default value.
     Minimization will only be done if they produce legal SGML (assuming
     'sgml-omittag' and 'sgml-shorttag' are set correctly).


File: psgml.info,  Node: Managing the DTD,  Next: Edit,  Prev: SGML declaration,  Up: Top

7 Document Type Declaration
***************************

PSGML needs to know about the DTD you are using for many of its
commands.  If you do not have a 'DOCTYPE' declaration in your file,
PSGML will try assume that there is one of the form

     <!DOCTYPE NAME SYSTEM>

   where NAME is the value of 'sgml-default-doctype-name', if the value
is non-'nil', else the GI of the first tag will be used.

   PSGML will try to parse the document type declaration the first time
you do something that needs to parse the document or immediately if the
variable 'sgml-auto-activate-dtd' is 't'.  You can also initiate the
parsing of the document type declaration with the command
'sgml-parse-prolog'.  Big DTDs take some time to parse.

   When the DTD has been parsed or loaded the name of the document
element will be displayed in the mode line inside brackets.  If there
was an error parsing the DTD or there is no DTD, the mode line will
display '[ANY]' (*** this is not really correct!  a DTD will be
established even if there are missing entities, it may even be empty).

File: psgml.info,  Node: Precompiled DTD Subsets,  Next: Using a Split Document,  Prev: Managing the DTD,  Up: Managing the DTD

7.1 Precompiled DTD Subsets
===========================

If parsing the DTD takes too long time you can arrange to have PSGML
cache an internal complied version of the DTD. Caching can be done of
DTD fragments in favourable situations.  It is possible to have an
external DTD subset cached but still have an internal DTD subset as long
as the internal subset does not define parameter entities that affect
the parsing of the external subset (*** what is the exact conditions?,
probably you can't use the cached external subset if the internal subset
defines parameter entities that are also defined in the external subset
with another value).

   To enable caching you have to create special catalog files, hereafter
called ECAT files due to (temporary) lack of imagination.  These
catalogs have similar syntax to the entity catalogs and there are two
variables containing lists of catalogs to search: 'sgml-ecat-files' and
'sgml-local-ecat-files'.  The ECAT files can contain the following types
of entries:

'file DTDFILE ENTITYDEF CFILE'
     The DTDFILE is the name of a file containing a DTD subset that
     should be cached in CFILE.  The ENTITYDEF is optional and if given
     have the following syntax:
          [ NAME1 LITERAL1 NAME2 LITERAL2 ... ]
     Using ENTITYDEF will modify the DTD subset by defining the
     parameter entity with name NAME1 to be LITERAL1, ....  The cached
     version of the subset will be created with those entity
     definitions, and when PSGML search for a matching cached subset
     will check that the parameter entities in ENTITYDEF has been
     defined with those values before trying to use 'cfile'.

'public PUBID ENTITYDEF CFILE'
     Cache the DTD subset with public identifier PUBID in file CFILE.

 -- User Option: sgml-recompile-out-of-date-cdtd
     If non-'nil', out of date compiled DTDs will be automatically
     recompiled.  If the value is 'ask', PSGML will ask before
     recompiling.  A 'nil' value will cause PSGML to silently load an
     out of date compiled DTD. A DTD that refers to undefined external
     entities is always out of date, thus in such case it can be useful
     to set this variable to 'nil'.

   Previous versions of PSGML have had another way of speeding up DTD
parsing.  This code remains in this version of PSGML, but is not
actively maintained and may disappear in the future.

   You can save the parsed DTD in a file using the command 'M-x
sgml-save-dtd'.  Next time PSGML can load that file instead of parsing
the DTD. For PSGML to find the saved DTD you must either save the DTD
using the default name or do a 'M-x sgml-save-options' after saving the
DTD. To directly use an already parsed and saved DTD, load the file
containing the saved DTD with the command 'M-x sgml-load-dtd'.

 -- User Option: sgml-default-dtd-file
     This is the default file name for saved DTD. This is set by
     'sgml-mode' to the buffer file name less extension plus the
     extension '.ced', if that file exists.  Can be changed in the Local
     variables section of the file.


File: psgml.info,  Node: Using a Split Document,  Next: Inserting a DOCTYPE,  Prev: Precompiled DTD Subsets,  Up: Managing the DTD

7.2 Using a Split Document
==========================

You can have the 'DOCTYPE' declaration in another file by setting
'sgml-doctype' to the other file.

 -- User Option: sgml-parent-document
     Used when the current file is part of a bigger document.

     The variable describes how the current file's content fit into the
     element hierarchy.  The variable should have the form

          (PARENT-FILE CONTEXT-ELEMENT* TOP-ELEMENT (HAS-SEEN-ELEMENT*)?)

     PARENT-FILE
          is a string, the name of the file containing the document
          entity.

     CONTEXT-ELEMENT
          is a string, that is the name of an element type.  It can
          occur 0 or more times and is used to set up exceptions and
          short reference map.  Good candidates for these elements are
          the elements open when the entity pointing to the current file
          is used.

     TOP-ELEMENT
          is a string that is the name of the element type of the top
          level element in the current file.  The file should contain
          one instance of this element, unless the last (lisp) element
          of sgml-parent-document is a list.  If it is a list, the top
          level of the file should follow the content model of
          top-element.

     HAS-SEEN-ELEMENT
          is a string that is the name of an element type.  This element
          is satisfied in the content model of top-element.


File: psgml.info,  Node: Inserting a DOCTYPE,  Next: Information from the DTD,  Prev: Using a Split Document,  Up: Managing the DTD

7.3 Inserting a DOCTYPE
=======================

*** Describe the DTD menu in general.  Describe customized entries for
special DTDs.  Mention 'C-c C-u C-d' for inserting a DOCTYPE from
keyboard.

   If you change the doctype you must execute 'sgml-parse-prolog',
changes in the doctype are not automatically recognized.

 -- User Option: sgml-custom-dtd
     Menu entries to be added to the DTD menu.  The value should be a
     list of entries to be added to the DTD menu.

     Every entry should be a list.  The first element of the entry is a
     string used as the menu entry.  The second element is a string
     containing a doctype declaration (this can be nil if no doctype).
     The rest of the list should be a list of variables and values.  For
     backward compatibility a single string instead of a variable is
     assigned to 'sgml-default-dtd-file'.  All variables are made buffer
     local and are also added to the buffers local variables list.

     When an entry is selected from the DTD menu, the doctype
     declaration will be inserted, the variables will be set to the
     values in the entry and a local variables list will be created in
     the buffer.

     Example:

             (("HTML" nil
               sgml-default-dtd-file "~/sgml/html.ced"
               sgml-omittag nil sgml-shorttag nil)
              ("HTML+" "<!doctype htmlplus system 'htmlplus.dtd'>"
               "~/sgml/htmlplus.ced"

7.4 Information from the DTD
============================

PSGML can list various information about the current DTD. The following
commands can be used via 'M-x' and can also be found in the DTD menu.

'sgml-describe-dtd'
     Display information about the current DTD.

'sgml-describe-element-type'
     Describe the properties of an element type as declared in the
     current DTD.

'sgml-describe-entity'
     Describe the properties of an entity as declared in the current
     DTD.

'sgml-list-elements'
     Will list all elements and the attributes declared for the element.

'sgml-list-attributes'
     Will list all attributes declared and the elements that use them.

'sgml-list-terminals'
     Will list all elements that can contain data.

'sgml-list-occur-in-elements'
     Will list all element types and where it can occur.

'sgml-list-content-elements'
     Will list all element types and the element types that can occur in
     its content.


File: psgml.info,  Node: Customizing DTD,  Prev: Information from the DTD,  Up: Managing the DTD

7.5 Customizing DTD
===================

PSGML can be customized by process instructions starting with "PSGML" in
the DTD. Generally this associates some information with element types.
E.g., if 'sgml-fill-element' should skip the element type or if the
content should be displayed with a special font.

   The general syntax is
     '<?PSGML ELEMENT' GI (PROP = VALUE)* '>'

   Note: in XML the ending delimiter is '?>', in SGML mode a trailing
'?' will be ignored if preceded by a space.

   Where GI is the element type, PROP is a propery described below, and
VALUE is the value for the property.  The first part from 'PSGML' to GI
is read with current setting for 'NAMECASE GENERAL', i.e., case
insensitive for normal SGML but case sensitive in XML mode.  The PROP
and VALUE is read using Emacs Lisp conventions, i.e.  case sensitive and
VALUE is a lisp expression (not evaluated).

   Example

     <?PSGML ELEMENT PRE nofill=t face=fixed-pitch>

   Properties

'nofill'
     Set to either 't' or 'nil'.  If 't' the elements of this type will
     be ignored when filling with 'sgml-fill-element'.  Note that Emacs
     normal filling functions will not honor this.

'font'
     Set to the name of an Emacs face.  Should be a face that exists in
     Emacs.  E.g.  'bold', 'italic', 'fixed-pitch'.  The content of
     elements of this type will be displayed in that face.

'attnames'
     Set to a list of attribute names.  E.g., 'attnames=("ID" "CLASS"
     "ONCLICK")'.  This controls the attributes included when using the
     'sgml-edit-attributes' ('C-c C-a') command.  Only the attributes in
     the list will be included and in that order.  You can also end the
     list with a '*' to include all attributes, but the listed
     attributes will be on the top.  E.g., 'attnames=("ID" "CLASS"
     "ONCLICK" *)'.  Note: that the attribute names need to be written
     with the correct case and in string quotes.

'structure'
     Control if element is included in 'sgml-show-structure' ('C-c
     C-s').  If set to 't', the element is included and if set to
     'ignore' it will not be included.  *Note Showing information:
     Information.

'help-text'
     Should be a string.  The string will be displayed by
     'sgml-show-current-element-type' ('C-c C-t').

8.1 Inserting Markup
====================

The commands that insert start-tags works only if the document has an
associated DTD.

   Keyboard commands for inserting:

'C-c <'
     Will ask, for the tag to insert, in the mini-buffer with completion
     on the tags that are valid at point ('sgml-insert-tag').

     If 'sgml-auto-insert-required-elements' is non-nil, tags for
     elements required between the inserted tags will also be inserted.

     The list of valid tags, computed for a position in the buffer, will
     contain:

       1. The end-tag for the current element, if it can be ended at the
          position.  Furthermore it will contain end-tags for enclosing
          elements if the necessary omissible end-tag declarations have
          been made in the DTD.

       2. The start-tags of all elements that could occur after point.
          If 'sgml-omittag-transparent' is nil, the above will be
          limited to the elements that can occur within the current
          element.

'C-c C-e'
     Insert start and end-tags for an element ('sgml-insert-element').
     The name of the element is read from the mini-buffer with
     completion on valid elements.  If 'sgml-insert-end-tag-on-new-line'
     is non-nil or the element has element content, the end-tag will be
     inserted on a new line after the start-tag.

     If 'sgml-omittag-transparent' is nil, the list of valid elements
     will only contain the elements that can be in the content of the
     current element.

     Required elements in the content will be automatically inserted if
     the option 'sgml-auto-insert-required-elements' is non-nil.  When
     the content model demands an element but there is more than one to
     choose from, a comment can be inserted with the available choices
     if the option 'sgml-insert-missing-element-comment' is non-nil.

'C-c C-i'
     Inserts a new element in the current element where it is legal.
     Prompts for element name with completion.  The completion list
     contains all elements that could be added to the current element
     somewhere, without making the content invalid.  This assumes that
     the content is valid to begin with.  Currently this list only has
     regular elements, not inclusions.  The new element will be inserted
     as late as possible in the current element (unless prefix argument
     is given, then as early as possible.)

'C-c C-r'
     Makes the region into a new element ('sgml-tag-region').  Reads
     element name from mini-buffer with completion as for 'C-c C-e'.

'C-c /'
     Inserts an end-tag for the current element ('sgml-insert-end-tag').

'C-c RET'
     Split the current element at point.  If repeated, the containing
     element will be split before the beginning of then current element.

     Typical use is to start a new paragraph element when inside a
     paragraph.

'C-c +'
     Read attribute name and value from mini-buffer and insert attribute
     specification ('sgml-insert-attribute').  If point is immediately
     after a start-tag, this command operates on that start-tag.
     Otherwise the command will operate on the element after point.

     The attribute name will be read with completion.  If the attribute
     has a token list as declared value the attribute value will also be
     read with completion.  The prompt for attribute value will
     typically look like:

          Value for ATTRIBUTE (TYPE Default: CURRENT VALUE):

'C-c C-u C-m'
     Give keyboard access to the customized part of the Markup menu.
     Emacs will prompt for the markup to insert using the menu line as
     selector.  (See SGML-CUSTOM-MARKUP below.)

   Menu bar:

'Markup'
     Selecting from this menu will insert markup.  The menu contains sub
     menus with tags and with entities, some other markup and a user
     defined section.

     Sub menus:

'Insert element'
     Pops up a menu of valid elements and insert start and end-tags for
     the selected element.  Selections from the menu works like the 'C-c
     C-e' command.

'Insert start-tag'
     Pops up a menu of valid start-tags and insert the selected tag.
     The menu has the same start-tags as the completion list for 'C-c
     <'.

'Insert end-tag'
     Pops up a menu of valid end-tags and insert the selected tag.

'Tag region'
     Pops up a menu of valid elements and tag the region with the
     selection.  Selections from the menu works like the 'C-c C-r'
     command.

'Insert entity'
     Menu of all general entities defined in the DTD.

'Add Element to Element'
     Pops up a menu of all elements valid somewhere in the current
     element.  The menu contains all elements that could be added to the
     current element somewhere, without making the content invalid.  The
     new element will be inserted as late as possible in the current
     element.

'Insert attribute'
     Pops up a menu with all the attributes of an element.  The element
     is either the one which start-tag is immediately before point or
     the element after point.  Selecting from this menu edits the
     attribute specification list for the element.

     The menu has a sub menu for every attribute which declared value is
     a token list.  The rest of the attributes are collected in one sub
     menu.  For the token list attributes, selecting a value will insert
     that attribute-value pair.  Selecting some other attribute reads
     the attribute-value from the mini-buffer and inserts the attribute
     value pair.

   A menu is also available directly with a mouse button click in the
buffer.  In GNU Emacs it is the first mouse button combined with shift
('S-<mouse-3>').  In Lucid Emacs it is bound to the third mouse button.
The mouse button click will pop-up a menu of valid tags or a menu of
attributes if the point is in a start-tag.  The attributes menu works as
the "Insert attribute" menu from the menu-bar.  The tags list is the
list of valid tags described above for command 'C-c <'.  Selection from
the tags menu works like the 'C-c <' command, with the following
exception:

   You can tag a region, with start and end-tag.  There are two ways to
indicate the region to mark:

  1. Use the normal mouse commands to mark region.

     For this to work you must either use "transient mark mode" (*note
     Transient Mark Mode: (emacs)Transient Mark.) or set the option
     'sgml-tag-region-if-active' to non-nil (don't set this unless you
     are sure that you want it).

  2. Alternatively make a secondary selection, this is done by holding
     down the meta key and using the mouse buttons.  *Note
     (emacs)Secondary selection::.  Some window managers intercept these
     events, which makes it hard use the secondary selection in Emacs.

 -- User Option: sgml-balanced-tag-edit
     If non-nil, inserting a start-tag using the context menu will also
     insert the corresponding end-tag.

 -- User Option: sgml-auto-insert-required-elements
     If non-nil, automatically inserts required elements in the content
     of an inserted element.

 -- User Option: sgml-omittag-transparent
     If non-nil, will show legal tags inside elements with omissible
     start-tags and legal tags beyond omissible end-tags.

 -- User Option: sgml-tag-region-if-active
     If non-nil, the 'Insert tags' menu will tag a region if the region
     is considered active by emacs.  If nil, region must be active and
     'transient-mark-mode' must be on for the region to be tagged.

 -- User Option: sgml-custom-markup
     Menu entries to be added to the Markup menu.  The value should be a
     list of lists of two strings.  The first string is the menu line
     and the second string is the text inserted when the menu item is
     selected.  The second string can contain a '\r' where the cursor
     should be left.  Also, if a selection is made according to the same
     rules as for the 'S-mouse-1' menu, the selection is replaced with
     the second string and '\r' is replaced with the selection.

     Example:

            (("Version1" "<![%Version1[\r]]>")
             ("New page"  "<?NewPage>"))

 -- User Option: sgml-insert-missing-element-comment
     If non-nil, and sgml-auto-insert-required-elements also true,
     'sgml-insert-element' will insert a comment if there is an element
     required but there is more than one to choose from.

 -- User Option: sgml-insert-end-tag-on-new-line
     If non-nil, 'sgml-insert-element' will put the end-tag on a new
     line after the start-tag.  Useful on slow terminals if you find the
     end-tag after the cursor irritating.

8.2 Markup completion
=====================

If you are typing in markup directly, 'M-TAB' will help you by
completing a tag name, an entity name or a markup declaration name.  If
you type 'M-TAB' after a plain word, 'ispell-complete-word' will be
invoked instead.

   If you have typed (-!- marks the position of point)

     &At-!-

and type 'M-TAB' (assuming you use the 'ISOLat1' entity set) you get:

     &Atilde-!-


File: psgml.info,  Node: Information,  Next: Indent,  Prev: Complete,  Up: Edit

8.3 Showing information
=======================

Commands for showing information obtained by parsing the buffer.

'C-c C-c'
     Shows in the message area: context at point, if in a tag or in
     mixed content and the open elements ('sgml-show-context').  The
     form of the string is controled by the user option
     'sgml-show-context-function'.

'C-c C-w'
     Shows what element the character after point (under the cursor)
     belongs to; also shows context of element ('sgml-what-element').

'C-c C-t'
     Show information about the current element type and the valid
     element following the point.

'C-c C-s'
     Show the major element structure in a separate buffer ('*Document
     structure*').  That buffer can be used to navigate the document,
     like an Occur buffer (*note Other Search-and-Loop Commands:
     (emacs)Other Repeating Search.).  The structure shows container
     elements and the text of the first child element (if it is not a
     container).  This works best for document types which uses
     containers and title structure (e.g.  '<div> <title>Heder</title>
     ..</div>').  PSGML uses a heuristic rule to identify container
     elements: it should have element content and be non empty.  You can
     configure exceptions from this rule using a process instruction in
     the DTD (*note Customizing DTD::).

     To include an element type EL1 that would otherwise be excluded:
          <?PSGML element EL1 structure=t?>

     To exclude an element type EL2 that would otherwise be included:
          <?PSGML element EL2 structure=ignore?>

   List contextually valid tags ('sgml-list-valid-tags').  Displays
information about current element, all valid end-tags, valid start-tags
in current element, and start-tags valid at this point but in other
elements together with the tags omitted.

 -- User Option: sgml-show-context-function
     The value shold be a function that generates a string from an
     element and the current markup type (if any).  There are two ready
     made functions for this.  The function
     'sgml-show-context-standard', the default, generates a string like
     '#PCDATA in para in chapter in book'.  The function
     'sgml-show-context-backslash' generates a string like
     'book\chapter\para'.

8.4 Indentation according to structure
======================================

You can indent a line according to the depth of element nesting at the
beginning of the line.  To indent the current line use '<TAB>'.  You can
also use '<LFD>' ('newline-and-indent') to start a new line with correct
indentation.

 -- User Option: sgml-indent-step
     How much to increment indent for every element level.  If nil, no
     indentation.

     If this is nil, '<TAB>' will insert a tab instead of indenting.

 -- User Option: sgml-indent-data
     If non-nil, indent in data/mixed context also.

8.5 Move in the element structure
=================================

These commands move in the element structure.  The commands uses
knowledge of SGML syntax, and if available the specific DTD.

'C-M-a'
     Move to the (content) beginning of the current element
     ('sgml-beginning-of-element').

'C-M-e'
     Move to the (content) end of the current element
     ('sgml-end-of-element').

'C-M-f'
     Move forward by element ('sgml-forward-element').

'C-M-b'
     Move backward by element ('sgml-backward-element').

'C-M-u'
     Move up to before current element ('sgml-backward-up-element').

'C-c C-n'
     Move up to after current element ('sgml-up-element').

'C-M-d'
     Move down to the (content) beginning of the next element
     ('sgml-down-element').

'C-c C-d'
     Move to the next place where data is allowed
     ('sgml-next-data-field').

   You can also move to the next place where there is some structural
error with 'C-c C-o' (*note Validate::).


File: psgml.info,  Node: Attributes,  Next: Change and delete,  Prev: Move,  Up: Edit

8.6 Editing attributes
======================

If you want to change the attributes of a start-tag you can simply edit
them directly in the buffer.  Or you can place the cursor at or after
the start-tag and use the 'sgml-edit-attributes' command, available from
the 'SGML'-menu or on 'C-c C-a'.  This will create a new Emacs window
with all possible attributes listed in the form

     ATTRIBUTE NAME = CURRENT VALUE.

   The CURRENT VALUE may be shown as '#DEFAULT' if the attribute has not
been given a value in the start-tag.  The list also contains the
attributes declaration as a comment.  Note also that the CURRENT VALUE
is show without eventual quotes.

   It is now possible to edit the attribute values.  You can move to the
next attribute with '<TAB>'.  If you want to let an attribute have its
default value use 'C-c C-d', this will insert a '#DEFAULT' in the value
field.

   If Emacs is running in an X window, the '#DEFAULT' will be underlined
to distinguish it from normal values.

   Finish the editing with 'C-c C-c'; this will replace the attribute
values in the main buffer with those edited.  Note that values will be
quoted as needed.

   If you want to abort the editing, you can remove the window with 'C-x
0' or if you want it neat, kill the buffer and remove the window.

   Some other keys are:
'C-a'
     Go to the beginning of the value field
     ('sgml-edit-attrib-field-start').

'C-e'
     Go to the end of the value field ('sgml-edit-attrib-field-end').

'C-c C-k'
     Clear the value field ('sgml-edit-attrib-clear').

'C-c C-d'
     Set the value field to '#DEFAULT' ('sgml-edit-attrib-default').
     This is a special value that will make the attribute be implied.


File: psgml.info,  Node: Change and delete,  Next: Translating characters and entities,  Prev: Attributes,  Up: Edit

8.7 Changing and deleting markup
================================

'C-c ='
     Change the name of the current element
     ('sgml-change-element-name').  Tries to translate attribute
     specifications.  An attribute will be translated to an attribute
     with the same name.  If the new element has no attribute with the
     same name, the attribute will be ignored.  If there is an attribute
     with the same name but different declared content, a warning is
     given.

     ID attributes are handled specially, an attribute with declared
     value ID will always be translated to the attribute with declared
     value ID.

'C-c C-k'
     Kill next tag, markup declaration or process instruction
     ('sgml-kill-markup').

'C-M-k'
     Kill the element following the cursor ('sgml-kill-element').

'C-c -'
     Remove tags from current element ('sgml-untag-element').

'C-c #'
     Convert character after point to a character reference
     ('sgml-make-character-reference').  If called with a numeric
     argument, convert a character reference back to a normal character.

'C-c C-q'
     Fills an element as a paragraph ('sgml-fill-element').  This is a
     substitute for the normal 'fill-paragraph'.  The command uses
     heuristics to decide what should be a paragraph.

       1. If point is in an element content, recursively fill the
          sub-elements.
       2. Find the biggest element with mixed content containing point.
       3. If the above element is mixed but contains elements with pure
          element content then fill what is between the pure elements as
          paragraphs and fill the pure elements recursively.

'M-x sgml-expand-all-shortrefs'
     Short references to text entities are expanded to the replacement
     text of the entity other short references are expanded into general
     entity references.  If argument, TO-ENTITY, is non-'nil', or if
     called interactive with numeric prefix argument, all short
     references are replaced by generally entity references.

'M-x sgml-normalize'
     Normalize the document in the buffer.  This will

       1. expand short references,
       2. insert missing tags,
       3. replace minimized tags with full tags,
       4. fix attribute specification lists according to options set.

     There is one argument, TO-ENTITY, with the same meaning as for
     'sgml-expand-all-shortrefs'.

     There is one option for the normalize command.  With its default
     value, normalize may actually change the data content of some
     elements.  But only by removing some white-space from the end of
     elements with omitted end-tags.

 -- User Option: sgml-normalize-trims
     If non-nil, 'sgml-normalize' will trim off white space from end of
     element when adding end-tag.

     Default: 't'.

8.8 Translating between characters and entity references
========================================================

Set the variable 'sgml-display-char-list-filename' to a file that
contains mappings between all characters present in the presentation
character set, and their "standard replacement text" names, e.g.  "å" ->
"[aring ]", e.t.c.

   The default value for this variable is 'iso88591.map'.

   Then use the functions (also in the Modify menu)

'sgml-charent-to-display-char'
'sgml-display-char-to-charent'

   to translate between entities and characters.

9.1 Folding editing
===================

With these commands you can make parts of the text temporarily invisible
to make it easier to see the overall structure of your text.

   When folding a region all the lines but the first will be invisible.
The first line of the region will still be visible with an ellipsis at
the end.

   *Note (emacs)Outline Mode::.

'C-c C-f C-r'
     The region between point and mark will be folded
     ('sgml-fold-region').

'C-c C-f C-e'
     The region between the start and end of the current element will be
     folded ('sgml-fold-element').

     This command can also fold the SGML declaration or the DOCTYPE
     declaration.

'C-c C-f C-s'
     Fold all the sub elements of the current element
     ('sgml-fold-subelement').

'C-c C-s'
'C-c C-u C-l'
     Unfold the current line, assuming it is the first line of a folded
     region ('sgml-unfold-line').

'C-c C-u C-e'
     Make all lines in current element visible ('sgml-unfold-element').

'C-c C-u C-a'
     Make all lines in current buffer visible ('sgml-unfold-all').

'C-c C-f C-x'
     Unfold current element and then fold the subelements
     ('sgml-expand-element').  If the current element is folded this
     expands what is visible.

(*note Using Multiple Typefaces: (emacs)Faces.).  The highlighting will
only be done if the variable 'sgml-set-face' is non-'nil'.  The default
settings make tags bold and comments italic, but this can be modified
with the variable 'sgml-markup-faces'.  When highlighting is on PSGML
will parse after every command until the whole buffer has been parsed or
user event occurs.

   To remove the highlighting type 'M-x sgml-clear-faces'.

 -- User Option: sgml-set-face
     If non-nil, psgml will set the face of parsed markup.

 -- User Option: sgml-markup-faces
     A list of markup to face mappings.  Each element looks like
     '(MARKUP-TYPE . FACE)'.  Possible values for MARKUP-TYPE is:

     'comment'
          comment declaration
     'doctype'
          doctype declaration
     'end-tag'
          end-tag
     'ignored'
          ignored marked section
     'ms-start'
          marked section end, if not ignored
     'ms-end'
          marked section start, if not ignored
     'pi'
          processing instruction
     'sgml'
          SGML declaration
     'start-tag'
          start-tag
     'entity'
          entity reference
     'shortref'
          short reference

*** describe sgml-save-options

 -- User Option: sgml-ignore-undefined-elements
     Start-tags for undefined elements will either be ignored, if
     'sgml-ignore-undefined-elements' is 't', or assumed to be
     acceptable in the current element and defined with 'O O ANY'

 -- User Option: sgml-range-indicator-max-length
     Maximum number of characters used from the first and last entry of
     a sub-menu to indicate the range of that menu.

     This is used for long menus of elements, tags or entities that are
     split into 'sgml-max-menu-size' big sub-menus.

If you encounter something that you think is a bug, please report it.
Try to include a clear description of the undesired behaviour.  A test
case that exhibits the bug, would also be useful.

   You can report a bug with the command 'M-x sgml-submit-bug-report'.

   When PSGML needs contextual information it parses the document up to
the point.  During the parsing, it builds a parse tree.  The parse tree
is used to initialize the next parse, to avoid having to parse things
already parsed.  Changes to the buffer is supposed to prune the tree of
all outdated information.  But if you get strange complaints from the
parser, try and back up a bit and use 'C-c C-o'
('sgml-next-trouble-spot').
