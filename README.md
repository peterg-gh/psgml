# `psgml` unofficial repository

## Summary

This repository is a compilation of various releases of
the EMACS LISP package 'psgml', which implements a DTD
driven editing mode for SGML forms in EMACS, with fairly
cool validation.

## Origins of content

The contents of this repository have been compiled the
original releases at `lysator' and the more recent release
for the Debian distribution at:

*   http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html
*   https://packages.debian.org/sid/psgml

The Debian package maintainers seem also to be the
current maintainers of `psgml`.

## Branches

This repository has a single linear set of commits in
three consecutive branches:

*   `lysator` for sources taken from the original site.
*   `debian` for sources taken from the Debian package.
*   `main` for local modifications.
