  * Bug fix: "psgml: speed up parsing when setting faces", thanks to Dave
    Love. Dave's patch typically makes parsing several times faster in
    Emacs if `sgml-set-face' is on.  It doesn't have any effect in XEmacs
    or Emacs when sgml-set-face is nil. It also avoids some compilation
    warnings and removes the setting of an unused variable outside the
    package's name space.                               (Closes: #292867).

psgml (1.3.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

  *  Bug fix: "psgml: xml-mode ignores the variable
    `sgml-xml-declaration'", thanks to Richard Lewis.   xml-mode
    overwrites sgml-xml-validate-command with a hard coded value, but
    sgml-xml-validate-command is supposed to be a user variable. This
    makes it impossible to replace nsgml with onsgml (which you want to do
    since nsgml gives a warning about xml.dcl containing large
    numbers). This fix moves the hardcoded value from xml-mode to the
    initial value of sgml-xml-validate-command.          (Closes: #274573).

    It tests global-font-lock-mode' to decide whether to turn on
    face-setting.  This has the disadvantage that you'd have to override
    `sgml-set-face' in `sgml-mode-hook', but I think it's worth it to DTRT

psgml (1.2.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preserve user changes in the site-start.d file. Also, do not delete
    the start file when removed, only when purged. This also requires that
    the start file do nothing when the package has actually been removed.

psgml (1.2.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-sgml-xml-971215
    + The SGML declaration must be implied and cannot be explicitly present
      in the document entity
    I did not like the suggestion in the bug report about just pretending
    that the document is SGML (yes, that would work, since XML is a SGML
    subset), but sone things that are veariable in the SGML world are
    fixed in XML, and we would have lost warnings about those. So I went
    and changed the verify command to set the env vars that nsgmls
    expects, and this should work now. closes: Bug#85005

  * browse-url-of-buffer used instead of nonexistent xemacs functions for
    browsing using netscape. Both these are thanks to Patrick
    Campbell-Preston <patrick@chaos.org.uk>. I am still working on the

psgml (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream Source
  * Excerpted changes:
        * psgml-parse.el (sgml-modify-dtd): set sgml-current-tree to
          sgml-top-tree. Needed by sgml-open-element.
        * psgml.el (sgml-mode): modify mode-line-format with subst, don't
          replicate the whole format in the code.
        * psgml-parse.el (sgml-external-file): Try to find system
          identifiers using the sgml-public-map
          if sgml-system-identifiers-are-preferred; this way that flag will
          have effect even if the sgml-public-map contains `'.
          (sgml-final): moved to be defined before use.
        * psgml-dtd.el (sgml-parse-parameter-literal): Try to handle
          character references to character number above 255 by leaving a
          character reference in then parsed entity text.
        * psgml-other.el (sgml-set-face-for): Nullify
          {after,before}-change-functions as well as (obsolete)
          {after,before}-change-function.
